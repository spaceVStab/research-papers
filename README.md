List of research papers that I have gone through.<br>
I will also try my best to update with writing the summaries of the papers.<br>

2. Fast RCNN - [Link](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Girshick_Fast_R-CNN_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf)
3. Faster RCNN - [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)
4. You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection - [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640)
5. U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation - [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)

## NLP
1. Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing - [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02709)

## Reinforcement Learning

1. MINERVA: A Reinforcement Learning-based Technique for Optimal Scheduling and Bottleneck Detection in Distributed Factory Operations - [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328189)<br><br>
Summary: Application of RL in job shop scheduling on the basis of Q learning. Optimal scheduling is based on deep learning approximation of the policy whereas the bottleneck detection is based on evaluation of production performance metrics
