1. MINERVA: A Reinforcement Learning-based Technique for Optimal Scheduling and Bottleneck Detection in Distributed Factory Operations - [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328189)<br><br>
Summary: Application of RL in job shop scheduling on the basis of Q learning. Optimal scheduling is based on deep learning approximation of the policy whereas the bottleneck detection is based on evaluation of production performance metrics
